#Here's your chance to be part of my betterment!#

Today is your lucky day! I'm giving you a once in a lifetime oppurtunity to be a part in my self-improvment quest. 

My name is Seve and I want to be a Front end web developer. I am currently the lead web developer for a small to medium size publishing company that mainly deals with financial and health publications & "e-newsletters". To see some examples of my companie's work, check your spam folder, it's usually where it ends up.

"Why do you want to be a web developer? you're already one." 

That's a valid point. The thing is my current position has me spread so thin that I end up spending about 20% of my day developing, the rest of my day is broken into, among other things.

	* Building 4 - 6 emails creatives per day, sending out a minimum of 2 proofs per email then setting them for deployment at specific times.

	* Creating email deployment reports for each email sent.

	* Creating Ad stats reports for the president when the email is an ad for a paid publication.

	* Create email subscriber reports tracking new sign ups, unsubscribes and health fall offs (Emails that are either fake or no longer active)

	* Create and send html for 3rd party email newsletters.

	* Cropping images for blog posts.

Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my time here. I have learned a lot in the last year, but the 2 most important things I learned while working here is that I know a lot more then I thought I did, and, at the same time, know a lot less.

"That doesn't make any sense" 

Here, let me explain.

I was hired as a Junior Web developer, working under the more senior developer. He had been working there for over 6 years and had built every website the company had. At the time that was 4 Wordpress blog sites plus a whole bunch of micro sites, landing pages and squeeze pages. 

The more I worked with him and the more I looked at his code, I suddently realized...

...He had no idea what he was doing.

PHP Errors and Warnings everywhere, sites built with tables...

But worst of all, was the client database that this companie's entire online ordering and payment system was running off of.

It was a single table, with 24 fields, storing 3 kinds of row records (News letter sign ups, News letter unsubscribes, and online payment orders)

Depending on what kind of row record it was, (which was determined by whether the Price field was blank or not) different fields would mean different things (such as the Address field in a signup would be used to track if the sign up came from a mobile device.)

This table had over 2.4 million records...

...and no ID field. 

So of course, after seeing this, I figured that I couldn't be considered a Junior web developer, I know way more then the senior web developer. 

However, in the last 6 months, in an effort to push myself to learn new web technologies, I started listening to several web development podcasts and reading web development blogs and realized "Oh Ok, I've got some work to do."

So I started "The Betterment of Seve" over at techsev@github.io/embetterment . It's not a portfolio site, because, honestly, the work I've been doing at my current company doesn't reflect my ability and my previous portfolio work is nothing to be bragging about.

So where do you guys come in? Well, I love learning, and using what I've learned in new projects, or being put on the spot and having to learn something to fix a problem. I want a job that's more then just installing wordpress on godaddy hosting and installing Yoast SEO, I want to create website that I'm proud to show off.
And after looking at your job application as well as some of the projects you guys are working on, I decided that I'd like to be a part of it.

I've included my resume but feel free to check out some of the other things I've created at

* techsev.github.io/embetterment
* www.github.com/techsev
* www.codepen.io/techsev

You can even go see my old portfolio site at www.sevest.com, although It hasn't been touched in a while.

"What if we look over your site and resume and don't feel you're qualified?"

Perfect, I'd love to know why. Please email me at techsev@gmail.com with what you feel I'm missing and It'll get added to my list of betterment goals.

However, if you do feel like I would be a good fit, I'd love to hear from you. You can contact me at the same email, or leave me a message on my voicemail line at either 289-500-9924 or 647-947-5651.

"Wow this cover letter is long."

Yes it is, and if you've come this far, then thank you, and thank you for your consideration.
